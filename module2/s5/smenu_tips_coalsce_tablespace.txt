Coalescing Free Space
====================

Space for tablespace segments is managed using extents, which are comprised of a specific 
number of contiguous data blocks. The free extent closest in size to the required extent 
is used when allocating new extents to a tablespace segment. Thus, a larger free extent 
can be fragmented, or smaller contiguous free extents can be coalesced into one larger free 
extent. However, continuous allocation and deallocation of free space fragments your tablespace 
and makes allocation of larger extents more difficult. By default, SMON (system monitor) 
processes incrementally coalesce the free extents of tablespaces in the background. If desired, 
you can disable SMON coalescing. 



If you find that fragmentation of space is high (contiguous space on your disk appears as non-contiguous), 
you can coalesce your free space in a single space transaction. After every eight coalesces the space 
transaction commits and other transactions can allocate or deallocate space. You must have ALTER TABLESPACE 
privileges to coalesce tablespaces. You can coalesce all available free space extents in a tablespace into 
larger contiguous extents on a per tablespace basis by using the following command: 


	"ALTER TABLESPACE tablespace COALESCE;"


You can also use this command to supplement SMON and extent allocation coalescing, thereby improving 
space allocation performance in severely fragmented tablespaces. Issuing this command does not effect 
the performance of other users accessing the same tablespace. Like other options of the ALTER TABLESPACE 
command, the COALESCE option is exclusive; when specified, it should be the only option.


Viewing Information about Tablespaces

To display statistics about coalesceable extents for tablespaces, you can view the DBA_FREE_SPACE_COALESCED view. 
You can query this view to determine if you need to coalesce space in a particular tablespace.
