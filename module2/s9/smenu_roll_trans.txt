How many transactions can a rollback segment handle concurrently ?
==================================================================
The maximum number of transactions allowed for a rollback segment is dependent 
on the 'transaction table slots' found in the header of the rollback segment. 
The first block of the rollback segment is called the segment header. The 
segment header contains a structure called a transaction table. The transaction
table contains slots (or rows) which keep track of all active transactions 
within that rollback segment. Each active transaction assigned to this rollback 
segment will also have a corresponding slot or row assigned to it in the
transaction table. Thereby, with a larger Oracle block size there is more room 
for a larger transaction table. In other words, more slots or rows can be 
inserted into the transaction table. The extent map is also kept in the 
segment header. 

   On Solaris:

         TRANSACTIONS          BLOCKSIZE
         ------------          ---------
             31                    2K    
             67                    4K
            140                    8K


HOW DOES THE OPTIMAL FOR ROLLBACK SEGMENTS WORK?Solution Description: 
=====================================================================

The optimal parameter does work for rollback segments, but under certain 
conditions.The process of deallocating extents is performed when the head moves
from one extent to the next.  At this time, the segment size is checked
and the RDBMS determines if the next extent should be deallocated.
That is, if a transaction needs to continue writing rollback information
from one extent to another extent in the rollback segment, Oracle compares
the current size of the rollback segment to the optimal size.

The extent can only be deallocated if there are no active transactions
in it.  If necessary, the RDBMS will deallocate multiple extents at one
time until the segment has shrunk back to its optimal size.  The RDBMS
always deallocates the oldest inactive extents as they are the least
likely to be used for read consistency.
