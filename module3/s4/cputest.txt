> Logical I/O Rate Test 
>  This script will generate output that can be used to 
>  correlate Oracle logical I/Os to CPU capacity and speed. 
>  This can be used to compare CPU speed between platforms and 
>  Oracle releases or to correlate workload capacity for the 
>  system in question. 
> 
>  The basic premise is that Oracle logical I/Os translate directly 
>  to CPU usage. By measuring the time it takes to execute a series 
>  of logical I/Os we can measure the rate a CPU can execute a 
>  logical I/O.  Since all logical I/Os are not the same, the numbers 
>  produced by this test should be considered theoretical maximums. 
>  These numbers will give values that can be used to measure CPU 
>  capacity and relative speed for an Oracle database, and should be 
>  within an acceptable margin of error. 
> 
>  NOTE: It is important that physical reads remain constant for each 
>  loop in order to insure that only logical I/Os affect the timing. 
>  A busy SGA may prevent this as well as CPU queuing for overall 
>  timing.  It is recommended that this test be run on an idle, or 
>  near idle machine. 
> 
>  The results of this script show the session logical reads 
>  performed for each loop, which should be constant, and the total 
>  time, which is in hundredths of a second. The statistic "physical 
>  reads" is included to verify that all blocks were cached. 
>  These values can be used to calculate the maximum logical I/Os per 
>  second that can be executed: 
> 
>  session logical reads / ( total time / 100 ) = maximum logical 
>  I/Os per second 
> 
>  If calculating for capacity against existing information 
>  (e.g. SYSMON data) then the total period (elapsed time) must be 
>  known, the total number of CPUs available, and some fudge factor 
>  (e.g. CPU queuing, SMP scalability): 
>    Interval capacity (with 20% fudge factor) = 
>      logical I/Os per second * total time * # of CPUs * .8
