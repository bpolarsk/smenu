 Change History
 - Fixed trace file level accouting for CPU time (had forgotten to avoid double counting at dependency level > 0 ). No changes required at statement level.
 todo: average rows fetched, single row fetches, mutli-row fetches
 is SQL*Net more data from client a round-trip? I think so.
 wait time per latch (had additional info for event "latch free", less relevant in 10g due to latch: ... wait events
 calculate elapsed time per module and action using time stamps after ACTION NAME, etc.
 turn into module
 retrieve index and column information on tables in trace use ORADBB module
 the same statement might be run at dep=0 and at dep=1, so don't save dep with stmt
 a separate section without aggregation in chronological order showing dependencies
 is probably appropriate
 statement as percentage of R
 map numeric optimizer goal to text
 latch names in 9i: unterschiedlich zwischen 9.2.0.?
 exec to parse ratio
 add debug flag
 10g WAIT hat auch tim=
 evtl. kann man durch Ausf|hrung mit cursor_sharing=force statement ohne bind variablen finden.
 connect als dba und prepare mit alter session set current_schema
 oder ersetzen von zahlen und strings durch bind variablen im statement und dann
 vergleichen, wie oft statement vorhanden ist
 look at #STAT and PARSING
 Idee: um nicht auf DBI angewiesen zu sein, kvnnte ich auch SQL Skript generieren,
 das weitere Infos aus der DB zieht
 rekursiv verbrauchte Zeit wird bei dep=0 Anweisung draufgeschlagen. 
 evtl. SQL Anweisungen nach Kosten sortieren
 - Die elapsed time e eines database call (z.B. FETCH) beinhaltet die elapsed time ela der wait events, die der
 database call verursacht hat. D.h. um die elapsed time des FETCH zu bekommen, muss man die elapsed times der
 wait events wegen des FETCH abziehen
 - total response time= time spent in database calls + time spent between database calls (only SQL*Net message?)
 - double counting von rekursivem SQL. Ausgabe wiederum bei Fertigstellung, d.h. rekursive Anweisungen stehen
 vor denen mit dep=0
 kvnnte berechnen: recursive user CPU, recursive SYSTEM CPU, dasselbe mit elpased time
 minimum and max. duration per event
 Bugs:
 the program does not take the rare possibility that two different statements might have
 the same hash value into account
 --------
 possible future enhancements:
aggregation of shareable SQL

    Applications that don't use bind variables are particularly troublesome to diagnose with traditional tools like tkprof or trcanalyzer, where one bind variable mistake can show up in your output as twenty thousand distinct problems with individual contributions of 0.005% of your response time. 
accounting of recursive SQL relationships

    Sometimes recursive SQL is the cause of a performance problem. When it is, you need to know the relationship that the recursive statements have to your application code. Oracle's SQL trace files contain all the information you need to see that relationship. 
          SQL statement text formatted for easier reading
          Histograms for wait events (I/O, latch, enqueue, etc.) to reveal information about skew in operation durations
          Statement-level statistics shown both inclusive and exclusive of recursive SQL (tkprof shows only one; which one varies by release)
          Identification of which PIO blocks are managed through the Oracle buffer cache and which are not
          Statement-level statistics shown in per-execute and per-returned-row form

=for commentary

according to Millsap, Optimizing Oracle Performace, page 88 these are
between database call waits:
pmon timer
rdbms ipc message
smon timer
pipe get
single-task message
I bet single-task message is no longer used since only two-task implementation
of ORACLE exists, even on VMS, have personally never seen it
pretty sure I saw 'rdbms ipc message' in slow truncates in 9i, so it might
happen within database call. See bug 5257478. It's CKPT that waits for it, so
also not relevent to applications which are served by foreground processes (which can't
get background process waits).
pmon timer and smon timer will never be seen in a foreground process either.

In all my testing I have never seen pipe get between database calls. I believe that it is
impossible, since you need to make a PL/SQL call with DBMS_PIPE to wait for pipe get,
the example below which calls DBMS_PIPE with a timeout of 10 seconds clearly shows that
pipe get is rolled up into the EXEC step of the cursor which ran DBMS_PIPE

LOBs are handled without PARSING IN CURSOR and EXEC (at least when used from Perl DBI through OCI. 
When commit occurs after LOB operation, cursor 0
is in trace file. This cannot be rolled up into any EXEC call, since there is none for
cursor 0. So log file sync for cursor 0 might have to be added to R.

direct path write/read due to uncached LOB is not rolled up into EXEC or anything else in this
10g trace from Perl DBI (same with DBMS_LOB)

				theoretically all waits except those classified as in between database calls
				should be rolled up into either PARSE, EXEC or FETCH
				at least with LOBs and direct path write this does not happen

=pod

Running the same statement with different optimizer settings or optimizer modes gives multiple entries in v$sql,
but hash_value and address are constant:
select hash_value,address, optimizer_mode, optimizer_env_hash_value from v$sql where sql_text='select 1 from dual';
HASH_VALUE ADDRESS  OPTIMIZER_ OPTIMIZER_ENV_HASH_VALUE
---------- -------- ---------- ------------------------
2866845384 2C990400 FIRST_ROWS               3223272689
2866845384 2C990400 ALL_ROWS                 1209944977
2866845384 2C990400 ALL_ROWS                 3201715534

So it's ok to use hash_value for accounting cost
