How to add Shortcuts :
======================
The shortcuts are used on the dot prompt. This is an alternate way of using Smenu.
To add the shortcuts in your environment, exit Smenu, go to your SBIN directory,
and just type ". ad" ( or . ./ad).  Shortcuts works only in ksh.

The SBIN directory is the root directory where you installed Smenu.


Why using Shortcuts  :
======================

Shortcuts add to your normal prompt a lot of commands. It gives 
immediate answer to your questions. Instead of journeying in all
menu's to launch a series of actions, you have the hability to 
launch these actions in sequence from the prompt. 

We have created on main shortcut :
 
          - sp   : All shortcuts for Oracle


Password :
==========
If you don't want to type in user and password each type, enter 
smenu (type sm) and go to module 1 option 5 to add user and passwords. 
Passwords are crypted. Some shortcuts works only with the user 'SYS',
but usely they works using the default user


Default user :
==============

The Default user is defined in SM/1.1. This is the user that is called 
by smenu to connect, unless instructed  by Smenu to use 'SYS'.
You may override the general default user for each SID in SM/1.13.

Add shortcuts :
===============

It is possible to add your own shortcuts : type 'vp' to edit addpar.sh 
(in SBIN/scripts), add the shortcuts.
Any shorcuts before 'sec3' is not visible by any 'sp' (show parameter) 
commands. However it will be part of your environment. 

Be aware that your own shortcuts will be lost when you update release, 
so we advise you to keep a separate copy of addpar.sh and reinitialize
after refresh.


Tricks :
========

If you don't want to put 'addpar.sh' (ad) in your environment, you may do the following to add quickly smenu just for you :

A) Add in you oracle (or what else is the owner of the DB) an alias called smd :
   alias smd='cd /$SBIN' 
   Where sbin is the Smenu root directory, so that you can directly attack 
   with the next command : '. ad'

B) make a symlink, to addpar.sh or to ad and type ". {mysymlink}


Use Smenu on other machine from this machine
=============================================

The best way is to add a dummy  entry in your oratab (so that you can use 'oa' to switch).
Add the sid in the tnsnames.ora on this machine and input the password for the remote user
in the form <passwd@REMOTE_SID> in sm/1.5

You must be aware that some (rare) features of smenu uses svmrgrl. However this feature is very interresting
to manage NT SID as if they were on Unix box.
